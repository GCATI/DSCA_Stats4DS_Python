The three main ones we will discuss in this course are the `Adjusted R^2`, `AIC`, and `BIC`. Before getting to these concepts, let's discuss the concept of `parsimony` and `Occam's Razor`.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Parsimony` (aka `Occam's razor`) is a general argument for choosing simpler models even though we know the world is complex. Occam's razor says that when presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, we should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. This is to say that all other things being equal, we should prefer a simpler model to a more complex one, especially when the data don't tell a clear story. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection approaches often go beyond parsimony to say that a more complex model must not be just better than, but a specified amount better than, a simpler model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a practical element to parsimony; simple theories are easier to test than complex ones. Similarly, simple models often do a better job at predicting. Because a simpler model requires fewer parameters it is also less expensive in terms of time or money to collect the data for it. \n",

For a particular statistical model, maximum likelihood finds the set of parameters *that makes the observed data most likely to have occurred*. That is, we find the set of parameters that makes the likelihood as large as possible.\n",

Here, we have a line of best fit, with the estimated values of the response variable $\\hat y_{1...n}$ (red dots). The actual values of the response variable (our data), are reperesented by the black dots. The residuals are indicated by the $\\epsilon$. These residual is the distance between the actual value of the response variable and the estimated value of the response variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we are calculating the maximum likelihood, we are looking for the parameters that maximise the likelihood of the data. The horizontal arrows trace up to the normal distribution which represents the fit. The closer to the peak of the distribution the data falls the \"more likely\" the data is given the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "For mathematical convience, we often work with the logarithm of the likelihood (the *log-likelihood*) instead of the likelihood. However, the parameters that give the maximum log-likelihood also give the maximum likelihood. \n",

    "\n",
    "Selecting models based on information criteria allows for the comparison of all candidate models at once, provided they are fit to the same data. If there are missing values in certain variables and not others, the model will exclude these data when fitting by default, so you need to be careful that you are not comparing models which have been fit to different datasets. \n",

    "$\\text{AIC} = -2L + 2k$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the log-likelihood and $k$ is the number of parameters in the model. As with all information criteria, small values represent better overall fits; adding a parameter with a negligible improvement in fit penalizes the AIC by 2 log-likelihood units.\n",

    "\n",

    "2. AIC comparisons are only valid for models that are fit to the same response data (i.e. same y)\n",

    "For AIC, the rule of thumb people generally follow is that improvements of greater than 2 mean we can select the more complicated model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BIC**\n",
    "The second most common information criterion, the *Bayesian* information criterion (BIC), uses a penalty term of $(log n)k$. The BIC is more conservative than the AIC, insisting on a greater improvement in fit before it will accept a more complex model. \n",

    "**Model Selection when there are several possibilities**\n",

There are some algorithms to do a combination or forward and backward selection. However, you want to be careful that this kind of model selection does not devolve into data-dredging. \n",

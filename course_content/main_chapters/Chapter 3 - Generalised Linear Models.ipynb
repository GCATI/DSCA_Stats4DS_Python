    "\n",
    "The traditional statistical approach was to assume that all variation in the data was normally distributed, or to transform the data until it was, and then use classical methods based on the normal distribution to draw conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In generalized linear models, variability isn't just a nuisance, but actually tells us something about the processes we are interested in. What we treat as \"signal\" and what we treat as \"noise\"  depends on our question. The same source of variability might provide an interesting insight into the data or be something we wish to account for so we can explore it further. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will introduce you to a few common distributions that capture different forms of variation in the response variable from the exponential family.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then give practical examples of how to fit and interpret these models using python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability and Random Variables (Discrete and Continuous) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is probability important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty and variability occur in many aspects of life. Probability helps us make sense and quantify uncertainties. Probability also helps us make informed decisions on what is likely to happened, based on patterns in the data collected.\n",

    "* `Probability` is the chance of an event occurring, defined between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 0 = will never happen, 1 = will always happen\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Random Variable` is the variable that takes values depending on outcomes of random events. It can be discrete if it can take distinct, separate values (country) or continuous (age, weight).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Probability distribution` the probability distribution for a random variable describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of the random variable. \n",
    "    * For a `discrete random variable`, x, the probability distribution is defined by a **probability mass function**, denoted by $f(x)$.\n",
    "    * For a `continuous random variable`, because there is an infinite number of values in any interval (e.g. you can always go to smaller and smaller decimals), we instead consider the probability that a continuous random variable will lie within a given interval. Here the probability distribution is defined by a **probability density function**, also denoted by $f(x)$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Both probability functions must satisfy two requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. $f(x)$ must be non-negative for each value of the random variable.\n",
    "  2. The sum of the probabilities for each value (or integral over all values) of the random variable must equal one. \n",

    "Now that we know how to define a probability for discrete and continuous random variables we can take a look at a few common probability distributions from the exponential family that we can use for our response variable including Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial. There is a large class of generalized linear models that we can use to model these different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal (Gaussian) distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already come across the normal distribution, which we use to inspect and compare our residuals. The normal distribution is arguably the most commonly used distribution in statistics. It is used for continuous variables (e.g. height, measurement error). It has several computational properties which make it easy to work with. For instance, it is symmetric, unimodal, and the mean, median, and mode are all equal. That means it can be captured just by specifying the mean and the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may use it to represent changes in population. Let's say you know the population mean but wish to understand how much it varies (e.g. by +/- 10\\%, +/- 15\\%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have two plots of the normal distribution, where the mean is the same: 0, but with higher (5) or lower (1) variance. \n"

    "The **exponential family probability distribution**, is the probability distribution which our response variable follows, for instance, Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial. \n",

    "The **linear predictor** is a linear combination of a set of coefficients and explanatory variables used to predict our response variable. This is essentially the same form used to specify our linear model, which means we can use the same formula set up for our GLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **link function** allows us to use the linear predictor by providing the link to connect the exponential distribution to the linear predictor. There will often be defaults for the link when you call the model family, but you can also specify this yourself. For instance, the Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution where values can take on integers between 0 and infinity. However, the linear predictor is based on the normal distribution which is continuous and can go from -infinity to infinity. It is therefore common to use a log link to log the response variable, which effectively limits the normal distribution to 0 to infinity, thereby making it suitable for the Poisson distribution. This means that we often need to do a back transformation when we interpret the parameter coefficients in the actual scale. For example, when using the log-link we would exponentiate the coefficients. \n",

Our data are count data because they count the number of times that cyclists cross the Brooklyn Bridge between Brooklyn and Manhattan (or vice versa) in New York City on a given day.\n",

    "Count data can also be expressed as rate data, since the number of times an event occurs in a time period can be expressed as a raw count. For instance, 2,400 cyclists crossed the Brooklyn Bridge in a day, or cyclists crossed the Brooklyn Bridge at an average rate of 200 per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poisson regression can be used to analyse count data and rate data. It allows us to determine the explanatory variables that are associated with our given response variable (the count or a rate).

The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.\n",

    "Notice that the Poisson distribution only has one parameter: $\\lambda$ (aka $\\mu$), this parameter tells us where the peak of the distribution is located on the x axis. By comparison, the normal distribution has a similar parameter, $\\mu$, which tells you where to locate the peak of the normal distribution. The normal distribution also has another parameter, $\\sigma$, the standard deviation which specifies the spread of the data around $\\mu$.

Effectively, for a poisson model to be appropriate, the variance = mean.\n",

In maximum likelihood estimation, the model is estimating the parameter values that are most likely  to have produced the data that were actually observed, that is they maximize the likelihood of the data. While in least squares approaches we want to find the parameters of the regression line that minimise the total squared distance between the data and the line. The approaches effectively amount to the same thing for our purposes.\n",

Generally, zero-inflated models first fit a logit or probit model to estimate zeros vs. counts, then fit a count model on the counts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis is a fluid process and there is no single approach. It can be thought of a process of hypothesis generation, data exploration, and formal statistical testing. It comes after the stage of importing and tidying your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will walk through organising your data, getting to know your data structure, and understanding variation and covariation within and between variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises we will use the **iris** dataset, which consists of morphological measurements of three related species of iris flowers.\n",

    "### Tidying your data\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct regression analyses in python it is important to have your data in a format that is easy to work with. A good approach is to organise your data as tabular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data is a set of values, where each `value` is placed in its own “cell”, each `variable` in its own column, and each `observation` in its own row. The book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham is a great resource when thinking about tidying data. Here, we use some of the definitions they set out in the book to describe tidy data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some definitions for tidy data**:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A `variable` is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.\n",
    "\n",
    " * A `value` is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    " * An `observation` is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In python, the *pandas* package makes it easy to format your data in a tabular format. \n",
